title: "Vector APP"
summary: "The vector Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraph (vAPP) surpresses starlight on both sides of a star using an achromatic pupil-plane coronagraph based on liquid-crystal technology. This enables an improved detection and characterization of exoplanets and their atmospheres."

The vector Apodizing Phase Plate is a coronagraph that uses a multi-layered patterned liquid crystal device to produce an achromatic phase response that spans up to one order of magnitude. The picture above shows a prototype that was specced to operate from 500-900 nm.
