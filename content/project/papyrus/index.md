The PAPYRUS project was brought to life by the PhD students supported by Postdocs and staffmembers at LAM in Marseille. It gathers the expertise and equipment that has been built up over the years to design and construct a state-of-art Pyramid Wavefront Sensor, to be installed at the 1.52 meter telescope at OHP.
